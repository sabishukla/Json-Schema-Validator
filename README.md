In This i wanted to show that i was not able to configure the Json Validation schema for when the datanum values are in string from a specific response,   SchemaValidatorsConfig config = new SchemaValidatorsConfig();
            config.setTypeLoose(true);
changes the type to the specific schema path but it fails to pick up multipleOf or any other keyword
could be that im missing something , would appreciate if you can correct me
